# Story

On his way home from college, Kaito is caught up in a Hero summoning and sent to
another world with three other students. With a development like this, would
they end up having to fight a Demon Lord?! That was what Kaito thought, but
according to Lilia, the one who summoned them, the Demon Lord was defeated a
long time ago, and the Hero is just summoned to be the main character of their
festival. Kaito, who was taken aback by this unexpected fact, decided to spend
his time relaxing in this peaceful world until a year passes, where they can
return to their original world. But even though he wished for peace and
tranquility, Kaito is blessed with a strange fate, as the big names of the Demon
Realm and the God Realm begin to gather around him...
