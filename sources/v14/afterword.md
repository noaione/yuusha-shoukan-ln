# Afterword

For picking up the 14th Volume of “I was Caught up in a Hero Summoning, but That
World is at Peace”, thank you very much.

In this volume, we’ve entered the latter half of the Six Kings Festival, and
Shiro finally makes her presence felt as the last boss felt. Also, Kaito’s
mother, Akari, who should already be deceased, made her appearance. For Kaito,
his parents are a very big presence, and even in the previous volumes, one could
really feel that he was somewhat unable to come to terms with their deaths. That
may become important in the upcoming battle with Shiro.

And regarding the Six Kings Festival, while it’s planned to be concluded in the
next volume, given its considerable length, it’s possible that it might take up
two volumes before it ends. Well, despite being called the last boss, Kaito and
Shiro aren’t enemies, as this was more of a test to Kaito for Shiro to grant his
wish, so they have promised to go around together on the last day of the Six
Kings Festival... The protagonist’s relationship with the last boss sure is
quite peaceful, isn’t it? The Six Kings Festival arc itself was so long that I
didn’t have much to add to it, so I’d like to add more after the Six Kings
Festival ends.

Thank you for reading to the end. I hope to see you again in the afterword of
the next volume.
