# Story

Caught up in a Hero Summoning, Kaito was sent to a different world “Trinia”,
where he spends a year in peace until the Festival of Heroes takes place, but
meets a Demon girl, Kuromueina, and falls in love with her. However,
Kuromueina’s true identity was actually one of the rulers of the Demon Realm,
the Underworld King! Furthermore, the Creator God, the Supreme Gods and the
Death King had also appeared around Kaito. In the midst of all this, Kaito went
to the Sacred Tree Festival held in the Elven city with his guardian Lilia and
the others, and spend a richly-colored time there—

## What is the Festival of Heroes?

Once every 10 years, a festival is held to honor the achievements of the First
Hero who defeated the Demon Lord and became the bridge of friendship between the
Demons and Humans, where a person from the same other world (Earth) as the First
Hero is summoned and invited to play the role of Hero. The one who plays the
role of Hero is treated as a guest of honor for a year before the main festival
occurs, and after the festival, they would be sent back to their home world.
