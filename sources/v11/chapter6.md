# Epilogue

In the centermost part of the God Realm, the Sanctuary... There were two Gods.

On one hand is the Creator of this world, Shallow Vernal.

On the other hand is a God of another world, Eden.

The two were seated at the same table, facing each other, drinking tea.

[...You seem to be in a good mood.]

[Yes, the curtains of one of the stages had been raised. However, it doesn’t
seem like you’d be interested in it. No, I suppose you were too interested in
other things for this.]

Hearing the words Shallow Vernal muttered, Eden said with a slight smile. That
another big event is about to begin...

[By the way, what about that matter which you said you’d consider?]

[Let’s see. This visit has been fruitful for me, and I’m grateful for allowing
me to continue to visit. As I myself am interested in him, and I do feel
grateful to you... It doesn’t seem like I could give you an answer that doesn’t
respond to your request.]

[In that case...]

[Yes, I accept your request... My beloved child’s parents, “Miyama Akari” and
“Miyama Kazuya”... I will “lend their souls to you”.]

Yes, that was what Shallow Vernal had been requesting of Eden for a long time,
but she hadn’t been able to get a good response from her. Even though she was
just lending these souls to her, for Eden who considers all inhabitants of the
world she had created her own children and loved them dearly, she was reluctant
to give up the souls of her children. However, Eden’s strong interest in Kaito
and her gratitude for Shallow Vernal, who was the reason she was able to meet
him, finally led Eden to grant Shallow Vernal’s request.

[I would need an explanation of the situation. I will rent only one of them to
you first. As for the other one, how about I pass it to you when before you
needed to use them?]

[That isn’t a problem. I give you my gratitude, Earth God.]

[I too am looking forward to the answer my beloved child would arrive at... and
the answer you would arrive at...]

[...]

Shallow Vernal didn’t answer Eden’s words any further, just quietly staring at
her face reflected in the cup of tea in her hand.
