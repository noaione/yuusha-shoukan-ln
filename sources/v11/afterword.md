# Afterword

For picking up the 11th Volume of “I was Caught up in a Hero Summoning, but That
World is at Peace”, thank you very much. This volume ends with an introduction
to the Demon Lord arc, which is a turning point in the middle stage of the
series. I’m sure Serious-senpai will be looking forward to the next volume.

In this volume, a new character has been introduced, Chris’ mother, Lilim. This
character is also someone who only appeared at the Six Kings Festival in the Web
Novel, so she has an early appearance. I mean, there have been so many new
characters that will appear at the Six Kings Festival that I decided to
introduce some of them early on. The battle involving the Demon Lord Vier in the
next volume is also different from the Web Novel due to the influence of
characters who made early appearances in the previous volumes. There will be a
lot of new content written in this volume, and I think it will be a bit of a
challenge for me, but I would be very happy if you could look forward to it.

After the Demon Lord arc ends, the Six Kings Festival arc will be next. That arc
is also going to be quite the long one, but there’s almost no seriousness in it.
It’s basically an arc talking about how Kaito is having fun in a festival
together with his lovers, so in a sense, it’s an arc that portrays what this
novel is all about.

Thank you very much for reading to the end. I hope to see you again in the
afterword of the next volume.
