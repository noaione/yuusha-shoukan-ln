# Intermission: Kuromueina — The Kind Monster Born from Nothingness

A monster was born in this world so long ago that it could even be called ancient times. Nay, rather than being born, I think it's more appropriate to say that this monster appeared out of the blue.

The monster was born with too much power, but at the same time, it had nothing else. A black smoky outward appearance without a definite figure, but its interior is empty—This monster whose only power, without any exaggeration, is the very concept of nothingness, and for this monster with an empty interior, it decided to search for it first.

First, a form of its own, and then, a heart of its own... And one after another, it went around the world searching for its own existence, as if it's fumbling around in the darkness.

Or perhaps, it might be a walking calamity traveling around the world. The monster touched many things and looked at many places in the world, and before long, it came to believe—

That this world—is full of impurities—

It couldn't be described as simple. It's really complex, too unstable and yet it can't do anything about it, and staggeringly vast and deep. Little by little, the impurities remained and accumulated in the monster's empty body as it traveled the world.

And then, how many years could have passed? A monster that has spent an unbelievable amount of time going around, storing up impurities in its body, the monster saw the world again from the place where it was born.

This world is full of impurities. It's not pure or rational, everything is uncertain and fragile. It's always changing, as if this world is one single existence.

And that's why, this world—is so beautiful and precious—

Silver-white hair swaying in the wind and golden eyes reflecting the world. A heart that has gained many impurities and the figure that appeared with a gentle smile on her face.

And thus, the monster that could have destroyed the world begins to walk again. It gained form and acquired a heart—establishing the collection of impurities it gathered as the testimony of its existence, it took upon the name of Kuromueina—and began to etch out its existence as it started out a new journey.

The story of she who bears that name—“The One who was Once a Monster” began with her reaching out to a little child who looked very much like herself in the past.

[Come with me!]

[...]

Holding the little child, she gave her the name “Ein”, named after her new beginning, the demon called Kuromueina was truly born into this world.

There exists a high-ranking Demon called Kuromueina. She held immense power, yet unconcerned with wealth and power, as she walked around as if she's wearing the very concept of freedom.

[Whoa, this is quite tasty, isn't it~~? One more please~]

[Thank you for your patronage!]

Kuromueina bought a spit-roast from a street vendor and ate it with relish as she looked out at the Humans' city bustling with activity from the incoming New Year.

Kuromueina often goes from place to place, sightseeing and eating. This is an unusual hobby for a stand-alone high-ranking Demon, where most of them set up their own territory, making their subordinates and dependents move in their stead, and don't go out much themselves, but Kuromueina liked to get involved with the world this way.

Kuromueina doesn't have a fixed form, depending on her mood, she could take the form of a boy or a young man, and in order to avoid causing a commotion for having a reasonably well-known name, she sometimes wears Information Concealment Magic in her peace time, getting these people on the street to not realize that this girl walking around with a spit-roast in her hand is a famous demon.

However, those who know Kuromueina will know that she's in a good mood when they see her walking around in her favorite appearance, the form of a young girl.

The Demon called Kuromueina is an oddball in many ways.

Although she's a high-ranking Demon, she doesn't have any subordinates, doesn't discriminate or look down on other races such as the Humans and the Gods, and openly speaks to the owner of a stall that can be called a commoner.

It's only because she truly loves this world and the people who live in it, despite everyone's differences. That's why she loves to take a leisurely walk around the city like this and watch the world change little by little.

Of course, she has her own tastes and preferences. Her favorite form is her current young girl form, but she can also take on the form of a magical beast when she's in a really bad mood, though that rarely happens. She has a sweet tooth, especially if it's large enough for her to eat while walking.

As far as others are concerned, she can be said to like basically people with any kind of personality, but she doesn't like those who do anything just to hurt anyone.

Yes, she has a very large number of likes, and conversely she has an extremely small number of dislikes. However, among such a wide range of likes, there is one that she has a special fondness for.

[...Oh?]

Kuromueina, who was leisurely strolling through the city with a smile on her face, stopped in her tracks. Out of the corner of her eye, she saw a large fountain and the figure of a young man standing in front of it.

Black with light brown hair, a face that isn't particularly beautiful nor ugly, a body that is somewhat lean but not unhealthy, and an average height of about 170 cm. For better or worse, mediocre was the word that applied to him, but Kuromueina muttered as she looked at the young man.

[...It's a baby bird...]

The expression on her face as she mumbled so is like a child who has found her favorite toy, and also like a mother looking at her beloved child.

“A baby bird”. Kuromueina sometimes describes others as such. However, it's not meant to describe someone as an idiot, rather, she meant well when she said that phrase.

The eyes of the young man looking anxiously at his surroundings, the subtleties of emotions behind his eyes... It was the same expression “her former self who had nothing” had and that's what she liked best.

That's why Kuromueina stepped forward towards the youth without the slightest hesitation. Cancelling off the Recognition Inhibition Spell on the young man, she also removed the effect of the Information Concealment Magic from affecting the young man...

[What's wrong? You look like you're in trouble?]

She called out to the young man with a big smile on her face, as if she was truly enjoying the encounter she had with “someone who looks a lot like her old self” that she hadn't come across for a while.

As she stroked the head of the young man—Kaito's head sleeping in her lap in a heartfelt affectionate way, Kuromueina gently smiled.

An innocent and lovable baby bird that still knows nothing, the existence that she most favors right now.

[Little by little, it's changing...]

Words she gently muttered.

She's empty, and yet she loves more than anything else to have someone who wants something in her heart... a baby bird who fumbles around in search of wings and wishes to fly, even if he doesn't know how to get them.

[Kaito-kun... One day, when your wings are fully grown and you're ready to take to the skies, I wonder what kind of beautiful wings you're going to show me? I'm really looking forward to it.]

To her, a baby bird is a being with “infinite possibilities”. Searching for something with their empty heart, and before long, when they find it, it would turn into their wings and help them fly away into the sky.

Most of all, she loves to see it happen up close and personal.

Gently moving her gaze, she could see many of “those who were once her baby birds”.

The high-ranking Demon who was named after the beginning, and the one who wanted to stay by her side longer than anyone else.

The Lich who has gained a lot of knowledge and is active in a wide range of fields.

The Fairy who loves nature and flew around innocently, away from the place she used to live in.

The Ogre valiantly laughed as he came to terms with his days being different from his kind.

The Human who got the answers she's looking for and became a Demon.

They are all different, but all of them have beautiful wings, and they fly around in the sky of this endless world together with her family that she can't help but love.

There's one high-ranking Demon called Kuromueina. She's an oddball who has great power and deep, warm kindness, and she continues to love this ever-changing world full of impurities and uncertainty.
