# Prologue

Welcome to the first volume of the project for testing!

This is an _italic_ text then continues with **bold** text.

This is an inline code `print("Hello World")` and this is a block of code:

```python
print("Hello World")
```

This is a list:

- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3

This is a numbered list:

1. Item 1
2. Item 2
3. Item 3

And I have some footnotes[^foot1] with another one[^here].

[^foot1]: This is the first footnote.

[^here]: This is the second footnote.
