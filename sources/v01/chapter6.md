# Epilogue

The sound of writing with a dip pen echoed throughout the room.

I was bewildered at first, but recently, I feel like I'm getting used to writing with this pen that needs to be dipped in ink.

[Kaito-kun? What have you been writing there?]

[Eh? Kuro? Since when are you...]

[Just now!]

[I see.]

Wryly smiling at Kuro's sudden visit, which has already become a regular occurrence, I put down the pen in my hand and turned to look at Kuro.

[...I was writing in my diary.]

[Diary?]

[Unnn. Well, I guess it's more like a letter than a diary...]

The first thing I bought with the money Lilia-san gave me was a simple A5-size diary notebook.

At the end of each day, I used to always start with a polite “Dear Mother, Father”, but since I came to this world and received the courage to move forward from Kuro, I've changed my writing style a little bit.

Dear Mom, Dad—

This diary is also a letter to my now deceased parents.

I've basically compiled a diary like this every year and placed them on my parents' graves when Obon Festival comes. Well, since I'm going through the crazy experience of coming to another world this year, I guess I'll have to make a two-year diary offering when I return home...

[Heehhh... Do you do this everyday?]

[Yeah, I write as if I'm reporting the events of the day to my parents who died a long time ago. I guess it has become a habit?]

[I see... Mind if I read it?]

[Eh? Y-You can't!]

When Kuro got interested in my diary and reached her hand out to it, I hurriedly closed my diary.

That's absolutely not possible. I can't let Kuro see this.

[Eh~~ Just a little peek.]

[No way! That's absolutely no good!]

[Buu!]

Kuro cutely puffed up her cheeks, but it won't work against my determination to not let her read this.

That's because, the diary I'm keeping now... the diary I've been keeping since I came to this world... Most of the things written on it are about Kuro... the memories I've had with her, and the feelings I have for her...

Showing such a thing to Kuro is nothing more than shame play!

Especially the things I've written today is definitely something Kuro must not see.

Dear Mom, Dad—I got caught up in a Hero Summoning and came to a different world. That world was different from the other world I had imagined, as it was peaceful and gentle... A very warm world.

In such a world, I met a Demon. Her name is Kuromueina.

She was cheerful and innocent, but I also felt this deep side of her that made me feel as if she could see through everything, and she had helped me out of the shell I've enclosed myself in. She has become someone so dear in my life.

Of course, I feel anxious about the days I'm going to spend in this world, but together with Kuro, I can be confident that it will be a happy and enjoyable year

That's why, holding upon the thoughts of reassuring you two, I'd like to say this again...

I was caught up in a Hero Summoning, but that world—is at peace.
