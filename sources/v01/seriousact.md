# Serious-senpai's Room: Act 1

A white-haired girl in a dark green sailor uniform was reading a book in a simple room located somewhere unknown. With only her sidelocks grown down to her chin and emerald-green eyes, she was reading by herself with a serious expression on her face.

Her name is “Serious-senpai”... She's the embodiment of the concept of “seriousness”, and even though she doesn't have any kouhai nor does she go to school... She's still your senpai. Loner she may be, she's still the resolute Serious-senpai.

The book Serious-senpai is currently reading is the first volume of the Light Novel titled “I was Caught up in a Hero Summoning, but that World is at Peace”, a story about the protagonist who was caught up in a Hero Summoning... but the Demon Lord was already defeated a thousand years ago, and that world is at peace.

[...If that's the case, you should have just written a story where that Hero from a thousand years ago is the protagonist!]

Within that empty room, the shout of Serious-senpai echoed in the air. It seems like she's upset with the development of the story.

[...Oops, I got a little heated up. It's only the beginning of the story, so I'm sure that I'll be showing up with a really important role later on.]

Serious-senpai... She's very optimistic, and even when she gets angry or depressed, she's able to bounce back like a phoenix. She may be the embodiment of the concept of seriousness, her thoughts are filled with positivity.

[Ohh, the protagonist got lost... T-This is fine! Isn't there going to be a fierce battle with that mysterious Demon that just showed up?]

From the point of view of others, “Serious-senpai may be the biggest gag in this novel”, but from how she sees it, she was very serious. The romantic-comedy style of the novel directly damages Serious-senpai's spirit, but the option of stopping herself from reading this novel doesn't exist for her. She can only move forward. After reading for a while, Serious-senpai took a... flag out of nowhere, with the word “romcom”, and snapped it in half.

[...Alright!]

She probably thinks that destroying that flag would snap the love flag that had been raised... “but whatever she did wouldn't change the content of the book”...

[Fumu fumu... Ohhh, the heroine's true identity has finally been revealed?! From the flow of the situation... This would be where bonds are formed after a tangled web of conspiracies and hardships... Now, no matter where it's from, come on!]

After regaining her fighting spirit, Serious-senpai read a few more pages, before collapsing on the floor.

[...It's already solved...]

The development she had hoped for didn't happen, and the serious flag was shattered.

However, bouncing back like a phoenix once again... Or rather, with the tenacity of a cockroach, Serious-senpai won't give up. Immediately standing up, she brought forth three flags with the words “lovey-dovey” written on them... but was unable to snap all of them at the same time.

[...This is tough.]

In the end, after taking the slovenly action of snapping them one by one, Serious-senpai opened the book again.

[...Date... Lovey-dovey... Gobfuu.]

Serious-senpai vomited blood. Being the embodiment of the seriousness, she couldn't handle lovey-dovey stuff, so much that seeing it makes her vomit blood.

In the end, Serious-senpai's desired development didn't occur even until the very end. She was slightly delighted by the appearance of a character called Death King, but unfortunately, the protagonist and the Death King still didn't meet in this volume.

[...Fuuu.]

After exhaling out... Serious-senpai snapped her eyes open and shouted.

[It really is freaking peaceful?! What the heck is happening? Where's the part where I appeared? Sure, I understand that there are large revisions from the Web Novel, but isn't it alright if you snoop in a great role for me?! Heck, I'm sure the readers would love to see me!]

However, the only person in that room is Serious-senpai... and even if she shouted such a thing, she would receive no response.

After a while, Serious-senpai, tired of shouting, put the book she had finished reading... properly into the bookshelf and muttered.

[...The second volume should be full of seriousness.]

Words holding upon her expectations... though it's something she herself hasn't realized yet.
