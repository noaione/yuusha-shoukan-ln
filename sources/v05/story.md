# Story

Caught up in a Hero Summoning, Kaito was sent to a different world “Trinia”,
where he spends a year in peace until the Festival of Heroes takes place, but
meets a Demon girl, Kuromueina, and falls in love with her. However,
Kuromueina’s true identity was actually one of the rulers of the Demon Realm,
the Underworld King! Furthermore, people from the Demon Realm and God Realm
started appearing one after another around Kaito... After having been invited by
the Emperor of Archlesia Empire, Kaito somehow ends up having a drinking contest
with the War King, and finally learns of the threat posed by the mysterious
Phantasmal King...

## What is the Festival of Heroes?

This is a festival held once every 10 years in honor of the achievements of the
First Hero who defeated the Demon Lord and became the bridge of friendship
between the Demons and Humans, where a person from the same other world (Earth)
as the First Hero is summoned and invited to play the role of Hero. The one who
plays the role of Hero is treated as a guest of honor for a year before the main
festival occurs, and after the festival, they would be able to return to their
world.
