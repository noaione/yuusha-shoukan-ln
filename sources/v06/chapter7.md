# Epilogue

Under the faint light shining through the stained glass windows, the nun, who
had been praying, slowly stood up. She then turned her head towards the other
person who was standing nearby in the dimly lit room.

[...Is that so, Kuromu-sama finally had... Thank you for telling me, “Hikari”.]

Hearing the gentle sound of her voice, the girl who was once called a Hero...
Neun’s expression hardened a bit.

[...Are you still not going to come back?]

[Sorry.]

[...You still haven’t finished atoning yet?]

[It still hasn’t ended... No, it would never end. After all, this isn’t just
atonement, it’s just self-gratification.]

Listening to the nun’s voice laced with sadness, yet no hesitation could be
felt, Neun only lowered her head, not saying anything else. After a few moments
of such silence, Neun turned on her heel and headed out of the church.

[...I’ll come back again, “Vier”.]

[Unnn, see you later, Hikari.]

Just as Neun said that while leaving the church without looking back, the nun...
Vier nodded with a thin smile on her face. Then, after looking over the back of
the Hero with whom she had once crossed blades with, Vier turned her attention
to the large amount of crosses that were pasted all over the walls of the
church.

[...Miyama Kaito-kun huh... He accomplished something I’m unable to do. The
otherworlder who saved Kuromu-sama’s heart... I wonder why? I’m feeling rather
frustrated.]

As she thought of the person important to her whom she can’t see now, the girl
who was once called the “Demon Lord” muttered to no one.

[But more than that... I’d like to meet him at least once. I wonder what kind of
child he was? If it’s someone Kuromu-sama likes, he must be very kind.]

After muttering that much, Vier shook her head, as if to shake off the doubts
she had in mind, and once again kneeled down in a prayer. The person she wanted
to meet... He was a being that had accomplished the feat of saving Kuromueina,
something that Vier couldn’t accomplish even after she had become the Demon
Lord. He who has accomplished it, she who made a mistake and failed... In a
sense... it may be inevitable that the two of them will eventually meet.
